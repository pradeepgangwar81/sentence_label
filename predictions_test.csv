11,"Amazed!-I've been using cheap men's body washes for a long time and they always seem to dry my skin out. Even when I've tried the so-called moisturizing ones, I end up with the same result... Dry and itchy skin. I thought I'd give the Method Men Body Wash a try, as it claims to not have any of the harsh chemicals as the cheaper body washes. I must say, I am completely sold on this stuff. First off, it smells amazing. A nice subtle scent that isn't overpowering like many of the other big name washes. Secondly it rinses cleanly and doesn't dry my skin out to the point of needing to slather my body in lotion after a shower. The price difference is well worth it.

I would have given it five stars, but it really rankles me that the manufacturer is trying to pass this product off as ""naturally derived."" The number two ingredient after water is sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), a surfactant and foaming agent that gives you that nice lathery feeling that tells you you're getting clean. Yes, it can be derived from coconut or palm oil rather than from petroleum, and I guess that's what the manufacturer means.

But it's still sodium lauryl sulfate, for Pete's sake. I'm no rampant environmentalist that is going to tell you SLS will give you cancer. The FDA has tested and approved it. But when folks look for natural ingredients, it's not usually SLS they are seeking. There are plenty of people who will tell SLS is very dangerous. Even mainstream folks recognize it can irritate sensitive skin.

Nice body wash. But don't tell me your SLS product is natural. Please. This is just betting on consumer ignorance.
